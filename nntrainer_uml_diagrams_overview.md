# NNtrainer UML Architecture Diagrams

This document provides an overview of the UML-compliant architecture diagrams created for the NNtrainer on-device neural network training framework. All diagrams follow UML standards and have been generated as PNG files using PlantUML.

## Generated Diagrams

### 1. High-Level Component Diagram
**File:** `NNtrainer_High_Level_Components.png`
**Source:** `nntrainer_highlevel_components.puml`

This diagram shows the high-level architectural components and their relationships:

- **Application Layer**: Contains applications, development tools, and platform integration
- **API Layer**: Provides C, C++, and JNI interfaces 
- **Core Engine**: Manages application context, execution engine, and model management
- **Computational Graph**: Handles network graph construction and execution
- **Neural Network Layers**: Implements the layer framework and loss functions
- **Optimization**: Contains optimizers, learning rate schedulers, and training strategies
- **Tensor Operations**: Manages tensor computations, memory, and backend support
- **Data Pipeline**: Handles data loading, buffering, and iteration
- **External Integrations**: Interfaces with NNStreamer, TensorFlow Lite, and platform APIs

**Key Relationships:**
- Applications use API layers to access core functionality
- Core Engine orchestrates computational graph execution
- Layers operate on tensors through the tensor operations layer
- Optimizers update weights during training

### 2. Training Workflow Sequence Diagram
**File:** `NNtrainer_Training_Sequence.png`
**Source:** `nntrainer_sequence_diagram.puml`

This sequence diagram illustrates the complete training workflow from model construction to inference:

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **Model Construction**: Application creates neural network through C API
2. **Layer Addition**: Layers are created and added to the model
3. **Optimizer Setup**: Optimizer is configured and attached
4. **Model Compilation**: Graph is built, memory allocated, and layers initialized
5. **Dataset Preparation**: Training data is loaded and prepared
6. **Training Loop**: Iterative process of forward pass, loss calculation, backward pass, and optimization
7. **Inference**: Model prediction on new input data

**Key Interactions:**
- Clear separation between API layer and internal components
- Systematic flow from high-level operations to tensor computations
- Memory management and optimization integrated throughout the process

### 3. Simplified Architecture Flow Diagram
**File:** `NNtrainer_Simple_Architecture.png`
**Source:** `nntrainer_simple_architecture.puml`

This activity-style diagram presents a simplified view of the architecture layers:

**Architecture Flow:**
- **Top-Down Organization**: From applications to low-level operations
- **Platform Branching**: Different API paths for C/C++ vs Android/Java
- **Parallel Components**: Shows concurrent aspects like different layer types
- **Core Processing Pipeline**: Clear flow through graph, layers, optimization, and tensor operations

**Features:**
- Conditional branching based on platform
- Parallel processing paths for different layer types
- Clean separation of concerns across architectural layers

### 4. Comprehensive Architecture Mind Map
**File:** `NNtrainer_Architecture_Mindmap.png`
**Source:** `nntrainer_mindmap.puml`

This mind map provides the most detailed view of the NNtrainer architecture:

**Hierarchical Organization:**
- **Central Node**: NNtrainer On-Device Training Framework
