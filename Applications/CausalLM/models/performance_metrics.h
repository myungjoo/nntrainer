   * The two duration fields above take the prefill->decode boundary where the
   * HOST loop leaves prefill, which on an asynchronous backend is BEFORE the
   * GPU has retired the work prefill submitted. A larger prefill block leaves
   * more queued, so prefill_duration_ms is short by exactly what the first
   * decode step then blocks on: "prefill TPS" reads high and
   * generation_duration_ms/generation_tokens reads low, by the same amount.
   * Measured, 0.3B/16383 tokens, same build: block 4096 -> prefill 3671 ms +
   * first token 1.90 s; block 1024 -> prefill 4989 ms + first token 0.53 s.
   * Sum 5.55 s either way, and 128-token end-to-end 7.68 vs 7.63 s.
   *
   * The fields below name the boundary instead of guessing at it:
   *  - prefill_duration_ms is corrected IN PLACE (queue drained at the
   *    boundary) only when the measurement drain is armed
   *    (NNTR_PERF_SPLIT_DRAIN=1, which only a measurement run sets);
   *    prefill_drain_ms says how much of it the drain accounted for, and is
   *    0.0 when the drain was not armed, i.e. on the production path.
   *  - ttft_ms and the per-step numbers are ALWAYS filled: they are host
   *    timestamps taken around the streaming callback and cost nothing.
   * Totals are what to compare across arms: ttft_ms and total_duration_ms are
   * drain-invariant by construction, the split is not.
   */
