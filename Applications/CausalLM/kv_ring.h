 * @brief Which attention arm this process runs on the Adreno image bundle.
 * @details Two arms, one environment variable:
 *
 *   kFast       (the DEFAULT, no environment)
 *               The throughput arm: the OHWI image path serves every layer the
 *               bundle can host. It is the arm every published number was
 *               taken on and the one that matches the previous release's
 *               speed. Its output is NOT guaranteed bit-identical run to run
 *               past ~2K keys on this driver (a rate that falls with the read
 *               span; see imageAttnLayer()).
 *   kPerLayer   (NNTR_DETERMINISTIC=1)
 *               The reproducible arm, opt-in. imageAttnLayer() decides per
 *               layer from detImageWindowMax(), which is 0: no layer takes the
 *               image kernels and the buffer/flash kernels serve all of them.
 *               The image bundle stays requested at process level, so a
 *               windowed layer keeps its KV ring (the flash kernels modulo-map
 *               the cache row). Measured cost against kFast on Adreno 840:
 *               +20~22 % end-to-end at equal token counts, prefill 2~4x slower
 *               (1.5B 1K ttft 1100 vs 477 ms; 0.3B 2047 1591 vs 674 ms),
 *               memory equal or a few percent lower. What it buys is
 *               bit-identical output across runs on every measured cell,
 *               including the long-context ones the fast arm does not
 *               reproduce.
 *
 * The deterministic arm used to be the default and the fast one the opt-out;
 * the measured cost above is why that was reversed. NNTR_DETERMINISTIC=0,
 * NNTR_ALLOW_NONDETERMINISTIC=1 and the pack's nntr_config
 * "allow_nondeterministic" are still accepted and now simply name the default.
 * An explicit NNTR_DETERMINISTIC outranks the pack key either way.

 *
 * 0, because there is no window width at which the image read is reproducible.
 * The bound used to be 512, on the reading that "a window-bounded layer's pass
 * walks ~W + block rows whatever the context, so it stays in the clean regime".
 * Both halves of that are wrong:
 *
 *  - The quantity the driver fails on is the number of texel rows ONE PASS
 *    walks, and for a windowed layer that is the prefill CHUNK plus the window,
 *    not the window: with C=1024 and W=512 the mirror span is 1024 rows at
 *    chunk 0 and 1536 rows after, so a W=512 layer reads as far as a
 *    full-attention layer at a 1536-token context does. The window bounds the
 *    MASK, not the read.
 *  - There is no clean regime, only a rate that falls with the span. Measured
 *    on the W=512 1.5B pack, per-layer arm, per-node hashes, prompt 3925
 *    (16K-context configuration, 4 generated tokens): 2 divergences in 28
 * consecutive identical-env runs, and in both the FIRST differing node is a
 * WINDOWED layer's attention op in prefill chunk 0 -- layer22_attention once,
 *    layer21_attention once -- with that layer's own K/V cache rows
 *    bit-identical, i.e. the perturbation is on the image side of the mirror
 *    and not in the cache. Over the 64 runs of the eight measured
 *    cells that is 1 event per ~7,600 windowed image prefill calls: small
 *    enough that 8 runs of most cells pass, far too large for a guarantee.
 *
 * So on the reproducible arm every layer takes the buffer/flash arm, and the
 * per-layer split survives only as an A/B: NNTR_DET_IMG_WINDOW_MAX=512 restores
 * it exactly. The KV ring is NOT given up with it -- the flash prefill/decode
 * kernels modulo-map the cache row, so a windowed layer keeps its ring and its
 * memory win; only the mirrors and the image kernels go.
 *
 * The fast default is not bounded by this: it puts every layer on the image
 * arm. NNTR_DET_IMG_WINDOW_MAX overrides the bound, in both directions, for
 * the A/B on the reproducible arm.

 *
 * MEASURED (Adreno 840, per-node output hashes over whole runs,
 * an earlier attribution): with the mirror image-written and the attention
 * split removed, 20 of 21 diverging run pairs have their FIRST differing node
 * in a FULL-attention layer's attention op, and a window-bounded layer NEVER
 * originates a divergence -- including with the ring forced off, so that its
 * mirror is full-context height and only its READ stays short. The failing
 * thing is a read_imageui pass over many texel rows of a buffer-backed
 * image2d, and its rate grows with the number of rows one pass walks:
 *   full-attention read span 2047 rows: 0 events in 15 pairs
 *                            4095     : 1 node in 1 of 3 runs

 *                            16383    : 1-769 nodes
 * A window-bounded layer's pass walks ~W + C rows -- the CHUNK plus the window,
 * not the window -- so with C=1024 it is already 1024 rows at chunk 0 and 1536
 * after, and RE-MEASURED at W=512 it does originate divergences there: 2 in 28
 * consecutive runs of the 1.5B 3925 cell, both first-differing at a windowed
 * layer's attention op in prefill chunk 0. There is no clean regime for it, so
 * detImageWindowMax() answers 0 and this function selects no layer on the
 * reproducible arm; the split stays reachable as an A/B
 * (NNTR_DET_IMG_WINDOW_MAX=512). The measured models are mostly windowed (0.3B
 * full at 7,15 of 16; 1.5B at 5,11,17,23 of 24; gemma4 3 of 15), which is what
 * the split would have bought and what the reproducible arm costs.
 *
 * The decision is STATIC per layer -- taken once at finalize, never flipped per
 * call. It has to be: on the image arm this step's K/V is written into the
 * image, not the buffer that aliases it, so a layer that served one call from
 * the image and the next from the flash kernels would read a mirror the buffer
 * does not have. Per-layer is safe for exactly the reason per-call is not: each
 * layer owns its own K/V cache and its own mirror, so the two arms never share
 * a store.

 * @brief Whether a TALLER prefill plane (a bigger block) pays for itself on the

 * @details The plane is charged per run; the block it enables is only worth it
 * where a launch carries a fixed per-launch cost that fewer, bigger launches
 * amortize. Measured, both directions:
 *
 *   Adreno image arm (NNTR_KV_IMG_ATTN) -- WITHDRAWN. The prefill-TPS numbers
 *   this used to cite (0.3B 16K 4370 vs 3078 TPS, 1.5B 16K 1037 vs 776) were
 *   read off an instrument that stopped the prefill clock before the GPU queue
 *   drained, so a bigger block -- which leaves more work in flight -- credited
 *   its own tail to the first decode token. Re-measured with the boundary drain
 *   armed (NNTR_PERF_SPLIT_DRAIN=1, see performance_metrics.h), end to end for
 *   128 tokens, Adreno 840 at 1300 MHz, warm kernel cache, ids identical in
 *   every pair, two orders (block 1024 first and block 4096 first):
 *
 *     prompt          block 1024        block 4096        e2e     honest
 *     0.3B  4095   2413 / 2501 ms    2824 / 2656 ms    -5.8%   826 vs 1286 MiB
 *     0.3B  8191   3804 / 3806       3978 / 3947       -3.6%   858 vs 1031
 *     0.3B 16383   7642 / 7622       7816 / 7809       -2.4%   858 vs 1032
 *     1.5B  3925   5284 / 5183       5530 / 5490       -5.6%  1706 vs 2343

 *     1.5B 16203  21100             22068             -4.4%  1963 vs 2152
 *   (the 1.5B 16K row is the only same-clock pair that cell yields -- 128
 *   tokens on a 16K context throttles the GPU below 1300 MHz about half the
 *   time, so cells at 1100 MHz or less were discarded rather than compared.)
 *
 *   The big block is slower at every length on both packs and costs +140 to
 *   +637 MiB, and it is slower on TTFT too, partly because growing the plane
 *   rebuilds the graph and replays the weight load -- 188..578 ms of setup that
 *   the plane-1024 arm does not pay. So: no growth on OpenCL, and the earlier
 *   "the block dominates on the image arm" reading was the measurement, not the
 *   machine.
 *
 *   Intel Xe flash/XMX arm -- was already a LOSS, at two prompt lengths:
 *     1.5B 1899 tok  xmx 4427 vs 4366 TPS (+1.4%), host peak 1663 vs 978 MiB
 *                    dp4a 1582 vs 1548 TPS (+2.2%), 1721 vs 972 MiB
 *     1.5B 3925 tok  xmx 3878 vs 3909 TPS (-0.8%), 1853 vs 1122 MiB
 *   and with the drain armed the +2% goes away too: at 1919 tokens prefill is
 *   439 vs 440 ms (xmx) and 1057 vs 1092 ms (dp4a) with the plane grown or not,
 *   while the grow path's graph rebuild adds ~190 ms of TTFT.
 *
 *   CUDA tensor-core arm -- UNCHANGED here, deliberately. The claim it rests on
 *   (1.5B 1899-token prompt, 8516 vs 8293 TPS prefill, VRAM 1226 vs 1166 MiB)
 *   was not re-measured at a length that exercises the block: the host 1.5B
 *   pack's window is 2048, so a prompt long enough to need more than one block
 *   is truncated. What that length does show is 230 vs 231 ms of prefill with
 *   the plane grown or not and ~140 ms more TTFT from the rebuild, i.e. no
 *   prefill gain either -- so this arm is a candidate for the same treatment
 *   once a long-window CUDA pack is available to measure it on.
 *
 * NNTR_PREFILL_GROW forces the answer either way (1 = grow anyway, 0 = never),
 * so an arm stays one env away from an A/B rather than needing a build.

 * @details This is the number the task "a big prefill block must not cost

 * so N_kv, and with it every per-step attention kernel (qk, row softmax, sv),
 * is the mirror's OCCUPANCY, not the window. Re-basing costs a back-fill of ~W
 * rows, so the mirror slid only when it was FULL, which made the occupancy --
 * and the decode cost -- a function of the mirror height, hence of Wcap, hence
 * of the PREFILL chunk:
 *
 *     C=1024 -> Wcap 2048 -> N_kv cycles ~1536..2048  (0.3B 16K: 48.7 TPS)

 *
 * Decode only ever needs W + 63 rows (one query row, the 64-floored base), so
 * bound the occupancy at W rounded up to the grid plus one slack band and
 * re-base when it is reached. The slack is what the re-base amortizes over: a
 * slide back-fills ~W rows of K and V once every `slack` steps, i.e. ~W/slack
 * extra rows per step against the ~W rows of attention every step already pays,
 * while the average N_kv drops from (height + W)/2 to W + slack/2.
